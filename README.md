In Android, Whenever we need to display a spinner item with image, text etc (i.e. creating more custom list) then we have to implement a custom adapter like base adapter. For customization we need to create a custom adapter class and then extends our default adapter in that class. Here we create a custom list using the overrided functions of adapter and display custom spinner. For more clarification about howâ€™s an custom adapter implemented firstly we need to understand spinner.</p>

<p>In Android, Spinners provides you a quick way to select one value from a set of values. Android spinners are nothing but the drop-downlist seen in other programming languages. In a default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value. It provides a easy way to select a value from a list of values.<p>
<b>Important Note:</b> Spinner is associated with Adapter view so to fill the data in spinner we need to use one of the adapter class.
